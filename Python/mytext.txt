The program uses a simplified form of compound interest,
in which the interest is computed once each year and
added to the total amount invested. The output of the
program is a report in tabular form that shows, for each
year in the term of the investment, the year number, the
initial balance in the account, the interest earned for that
year, and the ending balance for that year. The columns of
the table are suitably labeled with a header in the first row.
Following the output of the table, the program prints the
total amount of the investment balance and the total
amount of interest earned for the period.
